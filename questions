Questions:
1. A sensor could be in more than one collection since it would just need a subscription to the manager to give all of its temperatures. This means multiple managers may double count a sensor.
2. I could make a key which is required to run the sensors report, and only certain picos get access to that key.
3. The debug logs show the order in which the rules were run. All of the sensor pico rules were called before the full report was generated.
4. I could give a timeout and retry the scatter method just for the sensors which hadn't responded yet. I could know through their Rxs.
5. I could retry the scatter for the sensor picos which didn't respond. Also, I could just give the report of what responded.
